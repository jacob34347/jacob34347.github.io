            <p>Description: This was the second large project in my Intro to Digital Media course. 
                We had to create a video that taught a concept and brought together multiple forms of 
                digital media: image, audio, and video. As a ski instructor, I chose to distill an 
                advanced concept (angulation) by introducing it and making it tangible through dry 
                practice. This project was a piece of a larger website that I created for the course 
                on the topic of “angulation”. This website was also hosted in a VR space, so that 
                classmates could explore each other's websites and learn about new concepts. </p>
            
            <p class="reflection">Reflection: This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a virtual space 
                that leverages various digital media to teach a concept. Specifically, the learning 
                experience (i.e. website) utilizes new, effective media and is grounded in principles 
                of design and aesthetics. Each shot was planned and storyboarded to support these design 
                principles. </p>

            <p>Description: This was the final graduate project in my Intro to Digital Media course. 
                This Usability and Learning Evaluation Report was designed for us to see our learning 
                experience website through another's eyes, which led to re-evaluation and re-design of 
                the website. Four different users accessed my website (teaching the concept of 
                “angulation” in skiing) and filled out different reports on their experiences. I 
                observed Participant 1 while they used my website and asked them to perform different 
                tasks to monitor usability. Participants 2 and 3 accessed the website on their own and 
                filled out surveys. Lastly, Participant 4 evaluated the didactic and pedagogical aspects 
                of the website for effectiveness. Their answers yielded a large amount of data and 
                reshaped the website. </p>
            
            <p class="reflection">Reflection: This project demonstrates my ability to not only gather and analyze data, 
                but also apply the findings to strengthen the design and development of my digital 
                learning experience website. After receiving the user responses in my report, I revisited 
                my website and made edits to key design elements to create a more accessible and 
                user-friendly experience. </p>

            <p>Description: This project required researching a new, innovative learning technology and 
                creating a presentation of my findings. We were also required to evaluate benefits and 
                drawbacks of this technology for current and future use. Ultimately, this presentation 
                was recorded as a video and uploaded using VoiceThread. I chose to research virtual 
                reality, in particular a few programs that could enrich learning in the classroom: 
                TiltBrush, Wander, and ImmerseMe. These applications for VR headsets stand to strongly 
                enhance learning in the classroom, but raised a number of ethical questions and 
                considerations, particularly in regard to their accessibility and affordability for all 
                students. </p>
            
            <p>Reflection: This project demonstrates my ability to evaluate and understand the 
                responsibilities of a leader in technology pertaining to ethics. In this project I 
                identified issues with affordability with VR technology, as well as failures to make the 
                technology accessible for all learners, especially those with disabilities. I also 
                explored the lack of standards for manufacturers and developers, which have led to many
                 of the accessibility problems with the hardware and software. </p>
