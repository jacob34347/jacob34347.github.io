        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>My name is Jacob Singleton. I am a high-school German teacher in Kirkwood, Missouri. 
            I have taught for the past seven years in this district. I am an EdS student in the 
            Learning Technologies and Design program. I plan to finish this program in the summer of 2023. 
            I have very minimal experience with web design and development. I hope to gain a 
            better understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS. I hope to learn this new skill to 
            expand my future prospects. I have also always wanted to learn to code. <br/>I live with my wife, Randi, and newborn daughter, Emma. I love to ski. I work as a 
            ski instructor in the winter. I also love to hike, play games, and watch movies.</p> 
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I have Bachelor's degrees in German and History Education, and a Master's in German Studies.</p>
