        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Jacob Singleton. I am a high-school German teacher in Kirkwood, Missouri. I have taught for the past seven years in this district. I am an EdS student in the Learning Technologies and Design program. I plan to finish this program in the summer of 2023. I have very minimal experience with web design and development. I hope to gain a better understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS. I hope to learn this new skill to expand my future prospects. I have also always wanted to learn to code. 

            <br/>I live with my wife, Randi, and newborn daughter, Emma. I love to ski. I work as a ski instructor in the winter. I also love to hike, play games, and watch movies.
