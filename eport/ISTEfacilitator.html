            <p>I provide my students with Quizlet study sets for vocabulary learning in all my German courses, except for AP. While my students at all levels set goals for themselves and utilize data from our LMS to measure their own growth goals in each language skill, I treat vocabulary acquisition differently for my AP students. Because their needs are vastly different, I give them time at the beginning of each unit to create their own list of words and then to add on to this as the unit progresses. As these students will nearly all be in college next year, I want to emphasize to them the purpose of taking the initiative in their own learning by examining their own needs and goals. By the end of each unit, they must turn in a completed Quizlet study set with a substantial amount of words to support this. We discuss these as a class and look for similarities in our needs and goals.</p>

            <p>A large part of my daily life as a teacher is creating a virtual experience for my students that goes hand-in-hand with their in-person learning. Luckily, my district uses a spectacular LMS, Schoology, that makes this simple in most cases. I am able to post and grade assignments, provide an academic calendar of my course, host discussion forums, and create a virtual framework for my entire curriculum in the LMS. Furthermore, this links to even more virtual learning experiences, such as Quizlet and Edpuzzle, that allow me to create an even more enriching digital platform for my students to engage with. Also, navigating Canvas for many of my own courses in this Educational Specialist program has opened my eyes to new activities and uses for my own LMS. </p>

            <p>In <a href="islt9458reflect.html" target="_blank">ISLT 9458</a> (Technology and Assessment), our capstone project was a performance assessment. In my performance assessment, which I developed for an advanced German class, students were tasked with solving a contemporary problem, in this case: low voting participation in German high schools (among those who recently turned 18). To solve this, students had to follow a design-process, whereby they gathered information about a political party and then sought to make the topic relatable to the youth via a digital poster campaign. Creating this performance assessment has also had myriad effects in my overall assessment planning. Much more often now, I try to create authentic performance scenarios, where problem-solving and step-by-step design processes play a larger role. </p>

            <p>I have the benefit of working in a 1-to-1 school district and the creative benefits of student MacBooks has been game-changing. In a way, student devices democratize creativity. Instead of struggling to draw an image on paper or create a poster for a course, laptops/tablets offer a wealth of alternatives and programs that allow for new levels of creativity for almost any project or activity. For instance, I have a home-selling project in my German 2 course, where students must present the rooms of a home in the hopes of selling it. To do this, students had the choice of making a video or a presentation with any number of applications or programs. Some students even made homes in Minecraft and then recorded themselves through a streaming service (Youtube, Twitch, etc.). The project was open-ended enough that students were able to choose a route that best suited them, while still deeply exploring their own creativity! </p>
