            <p>While I use technology to promote personalized learning experiences on a daily basis as a teacher, this Educational Specialist program afforded me opportunities to hone my craft. For instance, in <a href="islt9467reflect.html" target="_blank">ISLT 9467</a> (Technology to Enhance Learning) the “Assessing Characteristics of Meaningful Learning” assignment allowed me to explore the hallmarks of a high-effect lesson that leveraged technology to personalize the learning. In the assignment I assessed the active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and collaborative learning that took place in the lesson plan. This assignment (and others like it) has helped to me to re-configure my approach to lesson design and how technology can help to tailor it to our individual learners. Specifically, it enabled me to recognize the most effective uses of technology in the lesson and translate these to my own lesson planning.</p>

        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>Like most educators, the COVID pandemic forced me to reconsider learning and assessment in quick order. Foremost, I more closely evaluated the relationship between what I taught and how it was assessed and, in the world of mixed learning where half of my class was virtual and the other half in-person, how I could provide experiences where students could not only learn, but demonstrate that learning in a more authentic way. As a result, I shifted focus to the concept of the performance assessment. We wanted students to show their learning in a real, authentic context that matched what they had learned. In <a href="islt9458reflect.html" target="_blank">ISLT 9458</a> (Technology and Assessment) I had the opportunity to strengthen my understanding of learning and assessing in the same authentic context. In the course I developed a strong performance assessment that has reshaped my assessments since. In this particular example (linked below), through placing students in the shoes of a German creating a campaign poster for an election, students were able to not only learn about the processes of the German election system, but also take part in it!</p>

            <p>In <a href="islt7361reflect.html" target="_blank">ISLT 7361</a> (Intro to Digital Media), I had the opportunity to explore innovative digital learning environments. In fact, the course even featured the creation and exploration of a didactic VR space. In the course, I created a website that was designed to teach a concept, in this case the concept of angulation and inclination in snow skiing. Important here was the mix of different forms of media to create a more engaging learning environment. I was satisfied with the end-product and learned how to create digital spaces that aid learners in active learning through a mix of different media!</p>
