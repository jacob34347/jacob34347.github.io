            <p>In this modern era, students are perpetually online and connected to others. I try to create as many experiences as possible in my class that utilize online collaboration and/or discussion to help to model appropriate interactions. Sometimes, I accomplish this through use of Google Docs for collaboration, but many times I use the discussion boards through my LMS (Schoology). I encourage students to not only state their opinions, but – just as important – to respond to their peers and find points for positive connection, even if they do not fully agree with their stance on an issue. At the large high school that I work in, I find that this helps students to connect with new peers in a way that promotes healthy online interaction.  </p>

            <p>Interacting with online news sources is a large part of our German language curriculum at my high school. Already on the first day of my AP German course, we discuss the credibility of online resources and I assign students the task of finding their own news report online and taking notes on it. Afterward, we discuss the sources that students selected; this also plays a large role in preparing students for the AP German examination, where the ability to identify reputable resources is key to their success. In addition to building a critical perspective for students, activities like this that I assign also afford the students a structural overview of the German language online mediascape. It is hard enough for students to be critical of sources in their native language, but navigating the nuances of digital literacy in another culture requires practice, which I try to facilitate. </p>

            <p>ChatGPT took the education world by storm in November 2022. Once again, the debate of ethical uses of online tools rose to the surface as my school district, as well as many others, developed task forces to try to combat the rising threat of student plagiarism of AI-generated texts. In my AP German course, we confronted this theme head-on with an in-class debate on the possible uses, as well as benefits and drawbacks of ChatGPT (and other AI chatbots). I used this as a springboard to further discuss intellectual property with the students and the importance of their own voice in their work. After all, chatbots can rearrange and regurgitate others' language that has been programmed into it, but what is the value of their own ideas? Can a chatbot inspire your essay or is that just someone else's original idea? The students appreciated this debate on the ethics and proper employ of AI chatbots, and we all learned much from it!</p>

            <p>Every teacher has a homeroom class on Thursday morning at my high school. One of the roles teachers have with these students is to facilitate digital citizenship lessons. Students will watch a series of videos on a topic, such as digital identity, data and privacy protection, among other topics, and then answer questions. Afterward, I facilitate discussion of the topics and implore students to reflect on their life in regard to the theme. Many themes, such as credit card purchase tracking and presentation of self on social media, lead to rich talks about issues in the students' own lives and ways that we can prevent these through better, more knowledgeable practices. Below is an image of the digital citizenship lessons I have completed with students.</p>
