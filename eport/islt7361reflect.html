        <h3>ISLT 7361: Intro to Digital Media</h3>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>This was the first course I took in my Educational Specialist program. It was a fantastic exploration of multimedia production techniques and methods. I learned how to use Photoshop, iMovie, and Illustrator proficiently, as well as other editing software. My work culminated in a didactic website geared at teaching a concept through a digital experience. We even explored the concept of learning in a shared VR space. </p>

        <p>While the course was enjoyable, it was also enlightening, and I learned much about the uses of digital media and the theories that scaffolded these. Furthermore, I learned how to leverage audio and visual media to achieve learning goals for various audiences. Though I may not use the software in this course consistently at the professional level – for instance, as a graphic designer or film editor – it still gave me a better understanding of the proper implementations of these and how they can serve an effective purpose in learning.  </p>
