        <h3>ISLT 9410: Computer Science for Educators</h3>
        
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>Course Description: This class focuses on giving educators a comprehensive background in computer science, as it appears in the Missouri high-school curriculum. </p>

        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>I took this class in the hopes of gaining a crash course on computer science, especially since I was taking ISLT 7355 (Web Design and Development) concurrently. I wanted to gain a more comprehensive knowledge of how computers worked beneath the surface and beneath what was strictly visible to us as users. I ended up learning more that I set out to in the first place, which was a pleasant surprise! Foremost, with computational thinking and algorithms, I learned a new manner of problem-solving and a new method of thought-process. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>Looking forward, I know I have a much richer understanding of how technology works around us in our daily lives. From the construction of webpages scaffolded by functions in code to the basic structure of the internet and the role of data in our lives, this class strongly shifted my perspective on the role of technology in the modern world. The course also served as a groundwork for my learning in ISLT 7355. The larger comprehension of the internet that I received from the class gave meaning and context to the website that I was developing at the time in ISLT 7355. Ultimately, I believe this course opened new doors for me and introduced me to a science I had previously had too little understanding of.  </p>
