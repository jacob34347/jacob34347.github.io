            <p>Every seven years my school district provides time for teachers on Curriculum Revision Committees to rewrite curriculum and seek out new resources. Throughout this past academic year, I have met with my fellow foreign language teachers to focus specifically on discovering authentic learning tools for our students. The vast majority of these are online and allow for tailored practice and access to realia that print media is unable to offer. We developed a shared spreadsheet where we listed all the resources that were available for each language, as well as ones that only had material for certain languages. Having the shared time to collaborate has yielded us a wealth of new authentic materials that will revolutionize the ways in which our students engage authentically with our content. </p>

            <p>In ISLT 9467 (Technology to Enhance Learning), I had to create a mindmap in collaboration with other students from the course. While most of us were teachers and had used mindmaps often in our classes, none of us had used Mindmeister. We were tasked with using it to develop a conceptual mindmap that mirrored exactly how we as a team saw our topic. It was a lot to handle at first, but we split the work into sections with each of us working as experts in a particular area. We also decided to proof each other's sections to ensure a unified and consistent voice and presentation. In the end, we were able to develop a strong product because we worked together regularly and traded ideas while collaborating in our shared virtual workspace.</p>

            <p>I run the German-American Partnership Program (GAPP) at my high school, which is an exchange program between our high school and one in Germany. When COVID canceled our trip in 2020, we were forced to find an alternative quickly. Our students already had partners, but we needed a way for them to connect and form real relationships despite being on the other side of the world. We decided to shift to a virtual format. We met together, teachers and students (from Germany and America) via Zoom to introduce ourselves and brainstorm ideas for partner and cultural connection in the month we had allotted for the program. To facilitate this, I developed a Google Form where students could rank their top choices for group activities. Because of this, the group was able to identify great activities and collaborate/connect with their partners from Germany!</p>

            <p>My school district's LMS (Schoology) has revolutionized communication and collaboration between myself and stakeholders. It also syncs directly to Infinite Campus, which is where our core data is stored and grades are posted, creating a one-stop-shop for our learning community. I can seamlessly communicate with parents and students through Schoology, both through messages and throughout comments on individual assignments. Because it has streamlined communication and collaboration, it has helped to promote more active use of the platform by all parties. With the support of peers and other stakeholders, it is easier than ever to make learning a communal experience. For this reason, I take care to curate my class pages and give consistent updates through Schoology.</p>
