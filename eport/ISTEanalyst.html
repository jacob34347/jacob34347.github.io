        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>The LMS (Schoology) in my district offers students numerous ways to engage with their own learning virtually. I use many of these in my own classes. For instance, students have the ability to check their own progress in each language skill by looking at their “Mastery” data. Based on their progress in a particular skill, such as reading, writing, listening, speaking, vocabulary and grammar, students can adapt their own study to reinforce areas of weaknesses. This can translate into many things; for instance, students struggling with grammatical concepts might seek out Youtube videos or additional exercises on Duolingo. </p>

            <p><strong>2.7.b Use technology to design and implement a variety of formative and summative assessments that accommodate learner needs, provide timely feedback to students and inform instruction.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>My LMS (Schoology) is also our assessment portal via an integrated program called AMP (Assessment Management Platform). Here we are able to design and assign formative and summative assessments that students can take on their own devices. Feedback is connected to the LMS and is shared live with both students and parents, as I grade. Having a cutting-edge LMS has redefined my analysis of data and my communication with students. Furthermore, AMP allows me to access rich data, such as student demographics and accommodations. Because of this, I can make adaptations to assignments virtually to facilitate assessments for students with various needs. Below is an example of a quiz hosted in AMP.  </p>

            <p><strong>2.7.c Use assessment data to guide progress and communicate with students, parents and education stakeholders to build student self-direction.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>The Assessment Management Platform (AMP) that is built into my LMS offers rich, historical data year over year. I compare assessments with historical averages and look for gaps in achievement. In my own classroom, I use this data to inform instruction and communicate points of improvement with students. Additionally, I compare this data with similar German courses at the middle schools across our district to identify further gaps, such as those based in student demographics (race, IEP/504, etc.). Lastly, students have the ability to see each of their assessments broken down by skill in AMP, which allows them to make changes to their own study habits to accommodate their language skill acquisition.</p>
