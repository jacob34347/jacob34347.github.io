            <p>As the department chair for world language teachers at my high school, I have led my colleagues on the proper implementation of our LMS (Schoology), particularly in regard to utilizing data. I taught my colleagues about the “Mastery” feature in our LMS, where students are able to track how well they are performing in each of the skill groups of their foreign language, such as speaking, reading, writing, and listening. Together now, as a department, we have been able to show our students how to access these records online and track their growth over time. This has enabled them to keep categorical progress of their own learning and make adjustments to their studies based on this data. As a result, our students exhibit enhanced mastery of the linguistic skills, as well as satisfaction in their ability to utilize these systems! </p>

            <p>As a foreign language teacher, one of the core areas of growth for students is vocabulary and it represents a piece of students' daily homework. In the past, flashcards were helpful for this. Today, applications like Quizlet expertly utilize research-driven methods to reinforce acquisition of new words. Unfortunately, not every student has access to a stable internet connection and these resources. To combat this, I took steps this year as department chair to formally request subscriptions to Quizlet Plus (among other applications/programs) for my colleagues and myself in an effort to ensure equitable access for our students.</p>

            <p>	After completing my research proposal for ISLT 9450 (Research Methods in ISLT), I was excited about Duolingo Classroom, which I had researched for the proposal. I found many studies that supported its effectiveness in the classroom and wanted to share it with my colleagues, as it seemed like a fun way to review content and gamify the learning. In the past few months since I made this suggestion, multiple teachers in my department have adopted the program and reported marked success with students. Most of them utilize the leaderboard feature and incentivize extra practice through rewards in class. As a department, we try our best to share resources with one another and this Educational Specialist program has given me many new ones to share!</p>
