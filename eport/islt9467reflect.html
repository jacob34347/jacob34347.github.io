        <h3>ISLT 9467: Technology to Enhance Learning</h3>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>Prior to this class, my expectation was that I would learn less than in my other courses, given how much diverse technology I implemented daily in my classroom. I was wrong. The specific focus in the course on higher-order thinking and high-effect strategies caused me to question many of my own technology tool uses, while also discovering new ones. As a result, this course had a direct and tangible effect on my own classroom instruction.</p>
    
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>In terms of discovery, many of the projects and assignments in the course presented me the opportunity to seek new tech tools for my own content area. I even learned about VR applications that offer opportunities for my students to really feel like they are in a foreign country speaking with native inhabitants! Alternatively, I also learned how to evaluate tech tools for classroom and district use using the SWOT model, among others. All in all, this course reconfigured my perspective on how to approach using technology in the classroom and at a larger collaborative level. </p>
