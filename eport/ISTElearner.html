            <p>As part of our on-going evaluation cycle, I am required to submit an online teacher self-evaluation form through our “MLP Professional Growth” portal. Here I reflect on areas of possible growth for myself as an educator and set growth goals and targets. My instructional technology use is central in the evaluation and it is one of the few areas where I have consistently scored in the top tiers: generally in our “innovating” category. After completion, I discuss my results with my supervising principal and my peers. This allows us to tailor our own learning to have the largest effect on our students' growth. </p>

            <p>For the nearly a decade, I have been a member of the American Association of Teachers of German (AATG). As a German teacher, it has been a vital lifeline to a larger community of learners, both at the local and global level. My membership allows me to participate in high-quality professional development focused on research-driven practices, as well as affords me opportunities to study in Germany during the summer. At the local level, we meet every October with German teachers from the region to organize events and take part in professional learning, generally provided by the Goethe Institut in Chicago. As a result, I am able to bring the newest, most effective strategies to my students.</p>

        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>As a member of the Curriculum Review Committee in my school district, it is of paramount importance that I am abreast of the newest trends in research in foreign language acquisition. To facilitate this, I am also a member of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). I routinely take advantage of my member access to online and print resources, including the <span class="fontI">Foreign Language Annals</span>, to find new material for myself and my students. The resources I have used from ACTFL have shaped the way I approach curriculum revision and classroom instruction. This is particularly evident in the field of technology, where new resources arrive daily and it is vital for the teacher to be expedient in their review of these for instructional use.</p>
