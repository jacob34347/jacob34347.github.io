            <p>Course Description: Development of skills and knowledge related to the systematic design of instruction. Emphasis is placed on content analysis, instructional strategies, and formative evaluation. </p>

            <p>I was uncertain what to expect when I enrolled in this course. I knew it was central to my degree and that it would include both technology and education, but that was roughly the extent of it. All that changed within the first two weeks, as we explored careers in instructional design and the variety and depth that are inherent in it. I knew that some teachers worked remotely, but I did not really know that my skills in technology and teaching were so wanted in other industries, be they in the tech world or even in business. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>This course taught me that everyone needs opportunities to learn, not just traditional students. In this class I enjoyed the chance to work on project team, identifying an institutional issue and addressing it through training. For our group, this was professional development on the effective utilization of educational and collaborative applications in the Google Suite. As an outcome, I learned not only how to better design instruction in my classroom, but also at other levels and in different settings beyond traditional education.  </p>
