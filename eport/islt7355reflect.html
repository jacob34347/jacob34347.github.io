        <h3>ISLT 7355: Web Design and Development</h3>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>This was my one of my favorite courses in the program. With every other course that I took, I brought some background knowledge or previous experience, if only a little. In this class, however, almost everything I learned was not only completely new to me, but I was able to witness the immediate effects of my newfound knowledge as I implemented it in my code for my website. By the end of the course, I had coded a website from scratch, and it felt great!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>While the class was a lot of fun, it was also difficult and consumed much more time than any other course in the program. I had to set aside time daily to grapple with new concepts and troubleshoot new issues that arose with the implementation of newer, more sophisticated code. I learned a new skill in this course that I can use in the future for many purposes. I also plan to take the more advanced course ISLT 7310 (Interactive Web Design) later this semester. Lastly, the course also taught me the power of resolve in the face of difficult circumstances and the positive effects of this resolve. </p>
