        <h3>ISLT 9458: Technology and Assessment</h3>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>This course was a nice follow-up to ISLT 9467 (Technology to Enhance Learning), which I took just prior to this course in Spring 2022. While ISLT 9467 was beneficial to my instruction and collaboration, this course altered my views on how I ought to use technology to assess learning in a variety of ways. I discovered new methods to assess large scale data, both at the classroom and district level, through learning analytics. I also learned new techniques and programs to assess students that have been greatly useful in my own classroom. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
            <p>Again, like ISLT 9467, this course changed my perspective on assessment. I found the concept of the performance assessment to be particularly helpful. I was able to create a project that I can use with my higher-level German students where the students’ own ability to perform in a mock political competition served as evidence of their growth. This model of assessment is valuable even without technology; though, with it, there were numerous pathways the students could take to display what they’d learned. As a result, I have begun to work these methods of assessment into all my classes. </p>
