        <h3>Teaching and Technology</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p><span class="fontI">T</span>he field of education has played a central role in my life since childhood. In elementary school my parents bought me a small easel and chalkboard as a gift, and my first instinct was to set up a classroom in our living room and teach them about the moon using powdered donuts and rudimentary drawings. Later in high school I looked to my Latin teacher as a role model and pictured myself in his shoes, teaching a class and engaging with learners. In short, it was never a question for me if I would eventually join the ranks of educators, but when and at what capacity. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>In college I acted towards my goals by dual majoring in History Education and German. After graduation, I received a Fulbright Scholarship to Germany, where I decided to pivot into the field of German education, and, following this, pursued my Masters in German Studies. Since earning my Master's degree, I have served as a German teacher in both middle and high schools, and I have truly enjoyed it. In recent years, I began to consider where I might go next in the field of education, and whether I should work towards a more advanced degree in curriculum design or technology. However, this line of thinking coincided with something else happening in my own department, which helped to clarify my direction. Simply put, I have become the de facto tech expert among my colleagues and hardly a day goes by where I am not assisting with technological issues or sharing my own integrations of technology into my curriculum and instruction. In truth, this has been a nice experience for me. Many of my hobbies are tied to technology in some way, and I have always had a relatively solid understanding of technology and its uses.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>I decided to study in the Educational Specialist degree program in Learning Technologies and Design because it would pave the path forward for me. It has allowed me to create a more relevant and effective classroom environment for my students right now. We are in a rapidly developing informational age, and technology stands to add high-effect value to my classroom instruction. Our students engage with numerous technologies daily and their literacy in this field is central to their future successes. Enriching instruction with technology affords students more valuable experience with these skills, in addition to creating a more effective learning environment.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>Looking back at my Specialist's program, I have learned and experienced a great deal, but a few things stand out. Foremost, I have learned that technology is a tool. It does not automatically make a lesson better through its inclusion – rather, the educator has to discern its most effective use. In discerning this, we transition from a view of technology as novelty to utility in the learning space. I learned this lesson in the first two weeks of ISLT 9467 (Technology to Enhance Learning) while completing an activity called “Assessing Characteristics of Meaningful Learning”. Of course, this was the introduction to the class; we spent the rest of the course identifying how best to implement tech tools. Additionally, this program taught me that there are far more opportunities in teaching and technology that I had previously known. Before this program, I assumed I was qualified to teach either in person or remotely, but any other job would require re-education. I learned differently in the first week of ISLT 9471 (Instructional Systems Design). One of the first assignments we had was to search websites for jobs related to instructional and curriculum design. Within minutes I discovered positions I had never expected, even a job at Babbel in Berlin where my German language skills and teaching experience made me a prime candidate. While I do not plan on pursuing one of these jobs at moment, I am trying to diversify my future prospects. For instance, learning to code my own website in ISLT 7355 (Web Design and Development) has been a useful new skill I have acquired in the past year. Lastly, this program has given me a valuable framework for future research. One of my favorite courses was ISLT 9450 (Research Methods in ISLT). Throughout the course of the semester, we developed a research proposal geared at a contemporary topic in our field. I chose a comparative look at the efficacies of Duolingo and Babbel, language learning applications that many of our high school students know well. The course gave me the tools I needed to pursue research in the future, from considering my own epistemology to obtaining institutional review board approval and identifying the best methods to carry out my proposed study. I will certainly use these skills in the future. </p>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>All in all, this program has allowed me to better serve as a resource for my colleagues, and a leader in our department. I want to be able to bring new ideas and implementations of new learning platforms to our World Language department. Our instruction has already evolved considerably in the past few years alone with virtual learning and newer, more dynamic learning management systems, and I want to see what else is on the horizon and how I can help to facilitate more positive change. Lastly, this program has created new opportunities for me. Currently, I plan to use this degree in my present capacity as a teacher. However, it also opens new doors for me in instructional coaching and technology facilitator roles in my own district or even jobs in instructional design and UI/UX positions, among others. This program has also laid the conceptual groundwork for my planned Ed.D. studies and the types of research I want to pursue in the future. I have a passion not only for education, but also for the exciting world of technology, and for what it can bring to those I teach and work with.</p>
