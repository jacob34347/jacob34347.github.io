        <h3>Teaching and Technology</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p><span class="fontI">T</span>he field of education has played a central role in my life since childhood. 
            In elementary school my parents bought me a small easel and chalkboard as a gift,
             and my first instinct was to set up a classroom in our living room and teach them about 
             the moon using powdered donuts and rudimentary drawings. Later in high school I looked 
             to my Latin teacher as a role model and pictured myself in his shoes, teaching a class and 
             engaging with learners. In short, it was never a question for me if I would eventually 
             join the ranks of educators, but when and at what capacity. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>In college I acted towards my goals by dual majoring in History Education and German. 
            After graduation, I received a Fulbright Scholarship to Germany, where I decided to pivot 
            into the field of German education, and, following this, pursued my Masters in German Studies.
             Since earning my Master's degree, I have served as a German teacher in both middle and high 
             schools, and I have truly enjoyed it. In recent years, I have considered where I might go 
             next in the field of education, and whether I should work towards a more advanced degree in 
             curriculum design, or technology, or even school leadership. However, this line of thinking 
             coincided with something else happening in my own department, which has helped to clarify my 
             direction. Simply put, I have become the de facto tech expert amongst my colleagues and 
             hardly a day goes by where I am not assisting with technological issues or sharing my own 
             integrations of technology into my curriculum and instruction. In truth, this has been a nice
              experience for me. Many of my hobbies are tied to technology in some way, and I have 
              always had a relatively solid understanding of technology and its uses.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>I decided to study in the Educational Specialist degree program in Learning Technologies and 
            Design because it will pave the path forward for me. It allows me to create a more relevant
             and effective classroom environment for my students right now. We are in a rapidly developing
              informational age, and technology stands to add high-effect value to my classroom 
              instruction. Our students engage with numerous technologies daily and their literacy in this
               field is central to their future successes. Enriching instruction with technology affords 
               students more valuable experience with these skills, in addition to creating a more 
               effective learning environment. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="indent paragraph">
        <p>Outside of the classroom, this program allows me to better serve as a resource for my
             colleagues, and a leader in our department. I want to be able to bring new ideas and 
             implementations of new learning platforms to our World Language department. Our instruction 
             has already evolved considerably in the past few years alone with virtual learning and newer,
              more dynamic learning management systems, and I want to see what else is on the horizon and 
              how I can help to facilitate more positive change. Lastly, this program creates new 
              opportunities for me. Currently, I plan to use this degree in my present capacity as a 
              teacher. However, it also opens new doors for me in instructional coaching and technology 
              facilitator roles in my district, and even lays the conceptual groundwork for my planned 
              Ed.D. studies and the types of research I will want to pursue in the future. I have a 
              passion not only for education, but also for the exciting world of technology, and for what
               it can bring to those I teach and work with.</p>
